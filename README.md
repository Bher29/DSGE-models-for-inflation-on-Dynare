# DSGE-models-for-inflation-on-Dynare
Simple DSGE (Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium) model on Dynare, to try to understand the reaction of the economy to technology/monetary shocks.
This DSGE model explores macroeconomic interactions between six main endogenous variables: output (y), consumption (c), inflation (pi), interest rate (r), capital stock (k), and technology (a). The dynamics of the model are influenced by two exogenous shocks: a technology shock (e_a) and a monetary shock (e_m).
The values chosen and the selection of parameters are based on the examples given by Dynare and on the literature available online.
